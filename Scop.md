## Observation

1. Users are allowed to sign up to the website without verifying email and even without entering the password.

2. If I initially sign up by providing my email and name but do not verify my email or set a password, and later attempt to sign up using a Google account associated with the same email, I am still able to complete the registration process successfully. This means that even though my email was previously entered but not verified, I can still create another account using the same email via Google sign-up. Ideally, the system should prevent multiple registrations with the same email, ensuring that an unverified email from a manual sign-up cannot be reused for a new registration through third-party authentication.
